# Pedal-Plane Avionics
Firmware for a pedal-plane special-effects controller.  It will do things like control the motor sound, machine gun lights and sound, and navigation lights.

This is very much a work-in-progress.

## Libraries
    1. cd to your Arduino libs directory.
        (The default is ~/Arduino/libraries on Linux
        or ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries on Windows)
    2. clone https://github.com/kdahlhaus/EventSystem
    3. Use the library manager to add:
        * ArduinoLog (or https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-Log/)
        * Tasker
